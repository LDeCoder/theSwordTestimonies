                            <h1 class="tpd2">TESTIMONY:</h1>
                                    <p class="tpd">When dealing with a difficult person, the Lord reminded me that people hurt others as a result of their own pain, past and present. The Lord showed me that this specific person is putting up walls out of fear, protection and instinctive self-preservation. This reminded me of the Wall of Jericho. This was a wall built around a city that was so thick they could drive chariots on top of it! In this battle, the Lord instructed them to march around the city once for 6 days, silently.  Then, on the 7th day, they marched 6 times silently and on the 7th time they shouted and the walls fell.  What the Lord showed me in this was to be around her but remain silent, allowing Him to speak to her through my kindness, gentleness, and love.  I'm not sure how long the "6 days" is, but I know that I will shout praises to Him when her Jericho Wall actually comes crashing down and her life is restored to what the Father intended for her - JOY! 
                                     She doesn't know how to trust, because others have abused her ability to trust by taking from her and not being dependable.  She fears love because she has given it, and it has not been reciprocated to her, but stolen.  Her heart is broken, and she WANTS to love and have friends, but she has no idea how.  
                                    
                                    You see, she is watching my every move, and one selfish act or reaction on my part could completely damage my witness to her.  The Lord showed me that it is not me she is lashing out at, but rather that HE is showing me a great opportunity to be His hands and feet and SHOW LOVE!  What I learned from this revelation is something my momma always told me, "the world doesn't revolve around me!"  What does this mean? Sometimes it is easy to take things personally that really have nothing at all to do with me!  Thank You, Father, for this revelation!<br/>
                                    He showed me to put on my full armor - You can read about this in Ephesians 6 <br/>
                                    <h1 class="tpd2">THE FULL ARMOR OF GOD:</h1>
                                    <h4>The Helmet of Salvation</h4> <p class="tpd2">This is used to guard my mind, keeping His thoughts in and the enemy's out.
                                    <h4>The Breastplate of Righteousness</h4> <p class="tpd2">This protects my heart, and reminds me that when the Father looks upon me, He sees the righteousness of Christ.
                                    <h4>The Belt of Truth</h4>  <p class="tpd2">His truth, not the enemy's lies!
                                    <h4>My Feet Shod with the Preparation of the Gospel</h4> <p class="tpd2">His Word says, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring the Good News!"  We get to bring HIS Good News!
                                    <h4>The Shield of Faith</h4> <p class="tpd2">When the enemy fires darts at me all the time, lies, the shield of faith protects me from these attacks.
                                    <h4>The Sword of the Spirit</h4> <p class="tpd2">The Bible, God's Word, my weapon.  When the enemy is able to deceive me, I use God's Word to heal the wounds caused by the enemy, because the enemy lies, and God IS TRUTH! <br/>His Word is like a healing balm to my heart, bringing peace, joy and restoration! 
                                    
                                    <br/>
                                    <p class="tpd">Pray for those who spitefully use you.
                                    Love your enemies AND pray for them, and <br/>
                                    ALWAYS speak life!! </p>
                            <br/>
                            <h1 class="tpd2">PRAYER</h1>
                                    <p class="tpd">Dear Jesus, <br/>
                                    I pray that you give me a compassion for this individual, <br/> and I thank you for giving me wisdom in this situation for how I can be an example of You to them. I know, because of Your love that shines in me, that they, too, will grow to love and trust You through my testimony.  <br/>Thank You, God, for going before me, being right by my side, and always having my back!  <br/>Thank You, Father, for BREAKTHROUGH! ~Amen!
                                    </p>
                            <br/>
                            <h1 class="tpd2">DECLARATION</h1>
                                    <p class="tpd">I am a child of God, and NO WEAPON formed against me shall prosper.  <br/>I am strong, confident, and a son/daughter of the King of Kings.  <br/>You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies, and MY cup runs over.  <br/>You said vengeance is Yours, so Father, I declare that <br/>You have given me a heart of compassion and love <br/>to pray for those who spitefully use me, <br/>and I speak LIFE over this individual. <br/>I pray that you prosper them.  <br/>I pray that you bless them.  <br/>And I declare that one day we will have a friendship, <br/>and I can share YOU with them. <br/></p>  <h3>~Hallelujah!</h3>
