                    <h1 class="tpd2">TESTIMONY:</h1>
                    <p class="tpd">There was a time in my life where the Lord told me to sign up to take some classes, and He told me if I would trust Him, He would pay for all of it, i.e. FREE SCHOOL! <br/>
                    I trusted Him in this and began declaring and believing for "FREE SCHOOL."<br/>
                    One particular morning, I was listening to one of my required readings by audio book, when the author said, "The greatest miracles are the ones we celebrate before they ever happen."
                    So, I sent my husband a text that I knew God already handled it but I wasn't sure how.  I told him we definitely needed to start thanknig God for the miracle, not just declaring it.
                    Little did I know, but the Lord had been working out some faith issues with him that morning as well.  He read a devotional that the Lord used to challenge him to take a leap of faith and go ahead and write the check for my classes.  (I feel it is important to note here that we had the money in the account, so this wasn't a "hot" check, but rather a challenge to step away from the safety net and allow God to provide the funds Himself). He accepted the challenge, trusted God, and had actually already left the check on the kitchen table before he left for work that morning!  That's amazing, right? Well, it gets better!<br/>
                    That afternoon, my mom stopped by my office with a couple of checks, because she and my grandma wanted to bless me with 1/3 of my tuition each!
                    Do you see, God told me the miracle was done, and t was! He had already impressed upon my husband to take a leap of faith and trust Him by writing that check, which he did.  Then, before we ever sent the check, God returned 2/3 of it!
                    Then, about a week later, as we celebrated His faithfulness, we received yet another check that covered the other third of my classes, so just as He promised, God provided FREE SCHOOL! Friend, God is faithful, and if He did it for us, He can't wait to do it for YOU TOO!

                    <h1 class="tpd2">PRAYER</h1>
                    <p class="tpd">Dear Jesus, <br/>
                    I trust you with everything.  I trust you with my family AND my finances.  Just as the father said of his son, "Lord, I believe, help my unbelief."  I trust, Lord, that you will help me to battle fear and doubt and replace them with complete trust in You, because just as Your Word says, You have gone before me and prepared the way.  Therefore, I trust that You have everything under control, and You WILL show me what my part is and where I must simply trust You to provide. ~Amen</p>
                    <br/>
                    
                    <h1 class="tpd2">DECLARATION</h1>
                    <p class="tpd">God is my provider.  He knows my needs even before I ask, so, Father, I trust You to provide for me.  Your Word says that if I ask you for wisdom, and I trust you, that You will provide it without holding back, so I am asking You for the wisdom to bring about wealth in my life.  I ask for wisdom to know how to handle all that You give me. You have made me a good and faithful steward of all that You bless me with, so I declare that I will be faithful with little so that You can make me a ruler over much.  <br/>Thank You, Father, for meeting ALL of my needs. <br/> ~Amen</p>
