                DEALING WITH A DIFFICULT PERSON <br/>
                
                When you deal with a difficult person remember that people hurt us as a result of their own pain, past and present <br/>
                Example: walls of Jericho 
                Perhaps the person is putting up walls out of fear, protection and instinctive self preservation <br/>
                Put on your full armor - Ephesians 6 <br/>
                Pray for those who spitefully use you <br/>
                Love your enemies AND pray for them <br/>
                ALWAYS speak life!! 
            
             <h1>PRAYER</h1>
            Dear Jesus, <br/>
        I pray that you give me a compassion for this individual, <br/> and I thank you for giving me wisdom in this situation for how I can be an example of You to them <br/>and because of Your love that shines in me, that they, too, <br/>will grow to love and trust You through my testimony.  <br/>Thank You, God, for going before me, being right by my side, <br/>and always having my back!  <br/>Thank You, Father, for BREAKTHROUGH! ~Amen!</p>
