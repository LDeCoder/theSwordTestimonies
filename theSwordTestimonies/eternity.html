        <h1 class="victory">Secure My Eternity:<br/> For God so loved the world, He gave His only son, that those who believe in Him would not perish but have everlasting life.  John 3:16</h1>
        <p class="etr2">
            In the Bible, God's Word, it says in Romans 3 that we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. This means that no one is without sin. Sin is what separates us from God. In Romans 6 it says that the penalty for sin is death.  God loves us so much that He gave his son, Jesus, to die on our behalf and pay that sin debt for us. This is found in John 3:16.
            Now we are able to receive that gift from Him and be returned to right standing with God.  We then are given eternal life, so we will spend eternity with Him in Heaven!
            If you would like to accept this gift of eternal Salvation and be assured that you will be with Him in Heaven, all you must do is accept it.  The Word says that they who call upon the Lord shall be saved!

            <h1 class="etr2">Prayer of Salvation</h1>
            <p class="etr2">
                Dear Jesus, <br/>
                I know I am not perfect, and I know you don't expect me to be, but I know I am a sinner and that the sin in my life is what has separated me from you.  I want to repent of my sin and live my life in a way that honors you and makes you proud.  I know it is a journey, and I want to do better each day.  Thank you, Father, for this gift of salvation that you made as a way for me to be in right standing with you.  Jesus, I accept your sacrifice on my behalf, and I receive you as Savior of my soul and Lord of my life.  Thank you for dying for me.  In Jesus' name. ~Amen
